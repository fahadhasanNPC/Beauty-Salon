>Introduction:
 Beauty Salon, A web-based site that allows users to choose a shop based on their
 salon needs, where the shops will offer a variety of services at a variety of prices. For
 people who want to manage time and want ease or relaxation, this web-based site can
 be a crucial option for users to explore options from various shops. The user gets the
 option to pick their preferred timeslot based on availability and book an appointment in
 a particular shop. Overall, this project helps skilled people create a business which is
 related to salons and run their business without any prior expense.
